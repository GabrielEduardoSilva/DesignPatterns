# Adapter ‚Äì iOS Conceptual Example with Authentication SDKs

This project demonstrates the **Adapter design pattern** in a minimal, abstract, and didactic way using concepts familiar to iOS developers. It shows how to reconcile incompatible interfaces so that client code can work with multiple third-party SDKs transparently.

## üìê Context

In real-world iOS apps, it is common to integrate third-party SDKs. However, these SDKs often provide **different interfaces** for similar functionality.

For example:

The `FacebookAuthSDK` already uses the expected method signature.

The `GoogleAuthSDK` uses a different method (`startAuthorization`) that doesn‚Äôt match what the client expects.

This example demonstrates how to adapt Google‚Äôs interface to match the common protocol without modifying the SDK itself.

## üß† Pattern Roles

| Role    | Implementation                                        |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Target  | `AuthService` protocol (expected by client code)      |
| Adaptee | `GoogleAuthSDK` (incompatible interface)              |
| Adapter | `GoogleAuthSDK` extension implementing `AuthService`  |
| Client  | `startAuthorization(with:)` function                  |	

## üß™ Example Usage

```swift
print("Starting an authorization via Facebook")
startAuthorization(with: FacebookAuthSDK())

print("Starting an authorization via Google.")
startAuthorization(with: GoogleAuthSDK())
```
### Output:

```
Starting an authorization via Facebook
Facebook WebView has been shown.

Starting an authorization via Google.
The Adapter is called! Redirecting to the original method...
Google WebView has been shown.
```

## üìå Benefits Illustrated

‚úÖ The client only depends on a unique interface (AuthService), not on specific SDK implementations.

‚úÖ Adding a new SDK only requires creating an adapter, not rewriting client code.

‚úÖ In Swift, you can implement adapters with protocol extensions instead of full wrapper classes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Drawbacks

‚ùóÔ∏è Adds an extra layer of indirection (extensions or wrapper classes).

‚ùóÔ∏è Multiple adapters needed: Each incompatible SDK requires its own adapter implementation.

‚ùóÔ∏è If the third-party SDK changes its API frequently, adapters need maintenance.

## üß± File Overview

All logic is contained in a single file for clarity and portability:
Adapter.swift

You can run this file in a Swift Playground, command-line project, or reuse it as a conceptual reference when designing SDK integrations in iOS apps.
