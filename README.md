 Design Patterns in Swift â€“ iOS Conceptual Projects

This repository is a collection of small educational projects focused on **design patterns applied to iOS development with Swift**, using **UIKit**, **SwiftUI**, and **modern architectural paradigms**.

ðŸ‘¤ **Target audience**: Technical recruiters, intermediate to advanced iOS developers, and anyone interested in clean, scalable architecture within the Apple ecosystem.

ðŸ“‚ **Navigation**: Each folder represents a design pattern. Inside, youâ€™ll find a specific README explaining the purpose and key takeaways of that example.
